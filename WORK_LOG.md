| Jan 13 | 6:35pm-7:20pm |                                                         I took some time to reread through the problem set and figure out how I wanted to approach it. I soon realized that I would likely have to keep track of multiple runs while looking at any given point in the array of temperatures. After some thought, I ended up settling on using a HashMap to keep track of these runs, with the latest temperature being the key and the run length being the value. I then took some time to begin my first draft of this approach. |
| Jan 14 |  8pm-8:30pm   | I continued to work on my first draft using a HashMap of the problem set. Eventually after making a few revisions I ran my code, however I now get a ConcurrentModificationException, and while I know the section of my code that causes that I'm not entirely sure how to go about fixing it. My code actually passes testEdgeCase and testTricky, however those only have a max run length of 1 so maybe that's why? Actually yeah because the problematic section of code that alters the run entries in the HashMap isn't run. |
