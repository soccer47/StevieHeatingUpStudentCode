| Jan 13 |  6:35pm-7:20pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I took some time to reread through the problem set and figure out how I wanted to approach it. I soon realized that I would likely have to keep track of multiple runs while looking at any given point in the array of temperatures. After some thought, I ended up settling on using a HashMap to keep track of these runs, with the latest temperature being the key and the run length being the value. I then took some time to begin my first draft of this approach. |
| Jan 14 |   8pm-8:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                        I continued to work on my first draft using a HashMap of the problem set. Eventually after making a few revisions I ran my code, however I now get a ConcurrentModificationException, and while I know the section of my code that causes that I'm not entirely sure how to go about fixing it. My code actually passes testEdgeCase and testTricky, however those only have a max run length of 1 so maybe that's why? Actually yeah because the problematic section of code that alters the run entries in the HashMap isn't run. |
| Jan 14 |  8:30pm-8:45pm  |                                                              I took some time to figure out what the error I was getting meant and how I could fix it. I realized that the problem was that I was trying to alter the HashMap of runs as I was iterating through it, which led to an error. I then came up with the idea that if I could instead have a different, temporary structure to make the changes to, then add those changes back into the original, I could avoid changing the HashMap I was iterating through. By using a holder HashMap to make the changes to as I iterate through the runs in the HashMap for each temperature, I was able to avoid the error and I now pass all of the tests except for testEfficientLarge. |
| Jan 14 |  8:45pm-9:10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I realized that I wasn't referencing the holder HashMap as I iterated through each run for the given temperature, meaning that there might be multiple runs added while running through with the same temperature. The most recent added instance of the key is kept, meaning that longer runs were therefore likely being replaced by shorter ones sometimes. I altered my code to instead reference/compare runs with the holder HashMap, and now I am much closer to passing the largest case, but still don't pass it. |
| Jan 14 |  9:10pm-9:15pm  | OH MY GOD IT WORKED. Because my code's answer to the largest test case (59) was so close to the actual answer (62), I knew there was likely some small edge case that was leading to the overwriting/non-addition of certain temperatures to longer runs. I realized that there was a possibility that the current temperature might be smaller than all of the latest entries to the runs currently in the HashMap, meaning that the current temperature could be the start of its own run, however it wouldn't be added by my code. I tried adding a new entry to the holder HashMap (key = current temperature, value = run length of 1) before going through all the runs with the given temperature, and now I pass all of the tests! |

I did this by taking out a few if statements that I realized weren't necessary, however I wasn't able to think of much else to improve. |

I have so far gotten through filling my array of edges and finding the longest run using a for-loop and longestPathTo, however I'm still working on completing my first attempt at the recursive longest-path-length finding method. |
